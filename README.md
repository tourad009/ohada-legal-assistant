# ⚖️ OHADA AI — Legal Assistant

**OHADA AI** is a minimal and efficient legal assistant specialized in **OHADA law**  
(Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa).

The assistant answers legal questions **in French**, based strictly on the legal texts provided.

> **Note:** The system does **not invent** legal content — if the answer is not in the documents, it will clearly say so.
